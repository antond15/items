## [Click to view the gallery](https://items.dejv.it/)

Simple image gallery for items which can be used in inventories, especially for [FiveM](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem).

I've started this project mainly to learn more with React and TypeScript in general.  
I know the struggle to find a great looking image that best fits your desired item.  
This should help server devs / config kings to save some time searching for images.

If you're looking for a great standalone / ESX inventory, take a look at [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory).
