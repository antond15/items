## [Click to view the gallery](https://items.dejv.it/)

Simple image gallery for items which can be used in inventories, especially for [FiveM](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem).

I've started this project mainly to learn more with React and TypeScript in general.  
I know the struggle to find a great looking image that best fits your desired item.  
This should help server devs / config kings to save some time searching for images.

### Contributions
If you want to add more images, you can by submiting a PR.  
The following requirements suit the most inventories.

New images must have:
- PNG format and transparent background,
- 100x100 pixels resolution,
- "just right" margin between the image content and image edge,
- lowercase A-Z name without spaces,
- complete data in JSON.

Image location - [`public/assets/images/`](public/assets/images/)  
Image data location - [`src/data/items.ts`](src/data/items.ts)
